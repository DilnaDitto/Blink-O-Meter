## Basic Details
### Team Name: [USELESS]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [DILNA DITTO M] -[CHRIST COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING]
- Member 2: [JIYA AB] - [CHRIST COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING]

### Project Description
[We‚Äôve built a tool called Blink-o-Meter, which can estimate a person‚Äôs confidence level just by analyzing their blinking rate using a webcam. The calmer you are, the fewer blinks per minute you have, and the higher your confidence score.‚Äù

Fun hook:
‚ÄúIt can even tell if you‚Äôre movie-villain-level calm üòà‚Ä¶ or just cutting onions üßÖ"]
